This is a simple audio player I made using code from Brad Traversy. His repo can be found here:

https://github.com/bradtraversy/html5audioplayer


Currently this audio player requires the user to manually add audio files to the media folder, and then list them in the 'playlist' in the index file. 

In future versions I would like to create a GUI of some sort that makes this user friendly and spits out an embed code for even the least technical users. 
Think music producers, artists, etc. 

I would also like to add download/sale options, with instant delivery. It could also be used as an email collector.

Some changes I added to this from the original are playing the song song when clicking the title in the playlist, and other minor bug fixes.


Enjoy!

**I developed this player in localhost and it was working fine. I haven't tested it on a live or mobile site yet!**

P.S.
The mp3's included were produced by me, and you may use them for any non-profit work so long as you credit Alex Gray. Thanks!
